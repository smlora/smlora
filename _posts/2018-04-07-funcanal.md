This presentation contains 4 topics; First and second topics deal with signal smoothing (compression) through spline estimators. 
Third topic presents a sample case for the use of spline and kernel smoothing for function mean data. 
The final topic discusses another a sample case for classification of functional data by implementaion of spline smoothing in conjunction with Functional-PCA:
